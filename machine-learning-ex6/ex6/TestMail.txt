Hi Bivash,

Happy New Year! I hope you are well. It's Jennifer from Aversan. I wanted to reach out to you to see if you are open to new roles? We recently received a heads up that we would be receiving a Systems Integration role for Honeywell in Mississauga. The role is initially 6 months but usually gets extended up to 2.5 years. I have no information as to what the project is yet and detail of when they expect to start hiring, but I just wanted to give you a heads up and see if you would be interested in this potential role? Also, for this role, they are OK with working as hybrid being onsite at Honeywell for some days of the week and working remotely for some days of the week. I have attached a copy of the job description for your review.

If interested, please fill in the attached NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) form. NDA form is required when I submit you to the system. However, if not interested and no longer available, please let me know.

Thank you and have a great day.

Regards,
Jennifer
